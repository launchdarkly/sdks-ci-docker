# ldcircleci/openapi-release

This Ubuntu image is used by the Releaser tool for releasing the [`ld-openapi`](https://github.com/launchdarkly/ld-openapi) project. It contains all of the language tools used in `ld-openapi` releases to build the various API clients and push them to package managers, and to run the OpenAPI code generator.
