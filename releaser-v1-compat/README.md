# ldcircleci/releaser-v1-compat

This Ubuntu image is used by the Releaser tool for releasing projects with old-style (v1) Releaser configurations that do not specify a Docker image. These used to be run directly on the Releaser host, so this image contains all of the same build tools that used to be installed on that host.
